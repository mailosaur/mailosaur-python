# [Mailosaur - Python library](https://mailosaur.com/) &middot; [![](https://github.com/mailosaur/mailosaur-python/workflows/CI/badge.svg)](https://github.com/mailosaur/mailosaur-python/actions) 

Mailosaur lets you automate email and SMS tests as part of software development and QA.

- **Unlimited test email addresses for all**  - every account gives users an unlimited number of test email addresses to test with.
- **End-to-end (e2e) email and SMS testing** Allowing you to set up end-to-end tests for password reset emails, account verification processes and MFA/one-time passcodes sent via text message.
- **Fake SMTP servers** Mailosaur also provides dummy SMTP servers to test with; allowing you to catch email in staging environments - preventing email being sent to customers by mistake.

### Installation

```sh
pip install --upgrade mailosaur
```

### Set your API key

Get your API key from the Mailosaur Dashboard and set it as an environment variable:

```sh
export MAILOSAUR_API_KEY='your-api-key-here'
```

### Create your code

Then import the library and create a client:

```py
from mailosaur import MailosaurClient
mailosaur = MailosaurClient()
```

### API Reference

This library is powered by the Mailosaur [email & SMS testing API](https://mailosaur.com/docs/api/). You can easily check out the API itself by looking at our [API reference documentation](https://mailosaur.com/docs/api/) or via our Postman or Insomnia collections:

[![Run in Postman](https://run.pstmn.io/button.svg)](https://app.getpostman.com/run-collection/6961255-6cc72dff-f576-451a-9023-b82dec84f95d?action=collection%2Ffork&collection-url=entityId%3D6961255-6cc72dff-f576-451a-9023-b82dec84f95d%26entityType%3Dcollection%26workspaceId%3D386a4af1-4293-4197-8f40-0eb49f831325)

## Creating an account

Create a [free trial account](https://mailosaur.com/app/signup) for Mailosaur via the website.

Once you have this, navigate to the [API tab](https://mailosaur.com/app/project/api) to find the following values:

- **Server ID** - Inboxes (servers) act like projects, which group your tests together. You need this ID whenever you interact with an inbox (server) via the API.
- **Server Domain** - Every inbox (server) has its own domain name. You'll need this to send email to your inbox (server).
- **API Key** - You can create an API key per inbox (server) — recommended — or an account-level API key to use across your whole account. [Learn more about API keys](https://mailosaur.com/docs/managing-your-account/api-keys/).

## Test email addresses with Mailosaur

Mailosaur gives you an **unlimited number of test email addresses** - with no setup or coding required!

Here's how it works:

* When you create an account, you are given an inbox (server).
* Every inbox (server) has its own **Server Domain** name (e.g. `abc123.mailosaur.net`)
* Any email address that ends with `@{YOUR_SERVER_DOMAIN}` will work with Mailosaur without any special setup. For example:
  * `build-423@abc123.mailosaur.net`
  * `john.smith@abc123.mailosaur.net`
  * `rAnDoM63423@abc123.mailosaur.net`
* You can create more inboxes (servers) when you need them. Each one will have its own domain name.

***Can't use test email addresses?** You can also [use SMTP to test email](https://mailosaur.com/docs/email-testing/sending-to-mailosaur/#sending-via-smtp). By connecting your product or website to Mailosaur via SMTP, Mailosaur will catch all email your application sends, regardless of the email address.*

## Find an email

In automated tests you will want to wait for a new email to arrive. This library makes that easy with the `messages.get` method. Here's how you use it:

```py
from mailosaur import MailosaurClient
from mailosaur.models import SearchCriteria

mailosaur = MailosaurClient()

# See https://mailosaur.com/app/project/api
server_id = "abc123"
server_domain = "abc123.mailosaur.net"

criteria = SearchCriteria()
criteria.sent_to = "anything@" + server_domain

email = mailosaur.messages.get(server_id, criteria)

print(email.subject) # "Hello world!"
```

### What is this code doing?

1. Sets up an instance of `MailosaurClient` using the `MAILOSAUR_API_KEY` environment variable.
2. Waits for an email to arrive at the inbox (server) with ID `abc123`.
3. Outputs the subject line of the email.

### My email wasn't found

First, check that the email you sent is visible in the [Mailosaur Dashboard](https://mailosaur.com/app/project/messages).

If it is, the likely reason is that by default, `messages.get` only searches emails received by Mailosaur in the last 1 hour. You can override this behavior (see the `received_after` argument below), however we only recommend doing this during setup, as your tests will generally run faster with the default settings:

```py
from datetime import datetime

email = mailosaur.messages.get(
    server_id,
    criteria,
    # Override received_after to search all messages since Jan 1st
    received_after=datetime(2021, 1, 1)
)
```

## Find an SMS message

**Important:** Trial accounts do not automatically have SMS access. Please contact our support team to enable a trial of SMS functionality.

If your account has [SMS testing](https://mailosaur.com/sms-testing/) enabled, you can reserve phone numbers to test with, then use the Mailosaur API in a very similar way to when testing email:

```py
from mailosaur import MailosaurClient
from mailosaur.models import SearchCriteria

mailosaur = MailosaurClient()

# See https://mailosaur.com/app/project/api
server_id = "abc123"
server_domain = "abc123.mailosaur.net"

criteria = SearchCriteria()
criteria.sent_to = "4471235554444"

sms = mailosaur.messages.get(server_id, criteria)

print(sms.text.body)
```

## Testing plain text content

Most emails, and all SMS messages, should have a plain text body. Mailosaur exposes this content via the `text.body` property on an email or SMS message:

```py
print(message.text.body) # "Hi Jason, ..."

if "Jason" in message.text.body:
  print('Email contains "Jason"')
```

### Extracting verification codes from plain text

You may have an email or SMS message that contains an account verification code, or some other one-time passcode. Mailosaur automatically extracts these for you and makes them available via the `codes` array on the message content:

```py
print(message.text.body) # "Your access code is 243546."

print(message.text.codes[0].value) # "243546"
```

## Testing HTML content

Most emails also have an HTML body, as well as the plain text content. You can access HTML content in a very similar way to plain text:

```py
print(message.html.body) # "<html><head ..."
```

### Working with HTML using Beautiful Soup

If you need to traverse the HTML content of an email — for example, finding an element via a CSS selector — you can use the [Beautiful Soup](https://pypi.org/project/beautifulsoup4/) library.

```sh
pip install beautifulsoup4
```

```py
from bs4 import BeautifulSoup

# ...

dom = BeautifulSoup(message.html.body, 'html.parser')

el = dom.select_one('.verification-code')
verification_code = el.text

print(verification_code) # "542163"
```

## Working with hyperlinks

When an email is sent with an HTML body, Mailosaur automatically extracts any hyperlinks found within anchor (`<a>`) and area (`<area>`) elements and makes these viable via the `html.links` array.

Each link has a text property, representing the display text of the hyperlink within the body, and an href property containing the target URL:

```py
# How many links?
print(len(message.html.links)) # 2

first_link = message.html.links[0]
print(first_link.text) # "Google Search"
print(first_link.href) # "https://www.google.com/"
```

**Important:** To ensure you always have valid emails, Mailosaur only extracts links that have been correctly marked up with `<a>` or `<area>` tags.

### Links in plain text (including SMS messages)

Mailosaur auto-detects links in plain text content too, which is especially useful for SMS testing:

```py
# How many links?
print(len(message.text.links)) # 2

first_link = message.text.links[0]
print(first_link.href) # "https://www.google.com/"
```

## Working with attachments

If your email includes attachments, you can access these via the `attachments` property:

```py
# How many attachments?
print(len(message.attachments)) # 2
```

Each attachment contains metadata on the file name and content type:

```py
first_attachment = message.attachments[0]
print(first_attachment.file_name) # "contract.pdf"
print(first_attachment.content_type) # "application/pdf"
```

The `length` property returns the size of the attached file (in bytes):

```py
first_attachment = message.attachments[0]
print(first_attachment.length) # 4028
```

### Writing an attachment to disk

```py
first_attachment = message.attachments[1]

response = mailosaur.files.get_attachment(first_attachment.id)
with open(first_attachment.file_name, 'wb') as f:
    for chunk in response:
        f.write(chunk)
```

## Working with images and web beacons

The `html.images` property of a message contains an array of images found within the HTML content of an email. The length of this array corresponds to the number of images found within an email:

```py
# How many images in the email?
print(len(message.html.images)) # 1
```

### Remotely-hosted images

Emails will often contain many images that are hosted elsewhere, such as on your website or product. It is recommended to check that these images are accessible by your recipients.

All images should have an alternative text description, which can be checked using the `alt` attribute.

```py
image = message.html.images[0]
print(image.alt) # "Hot air balloon"
```

### Triggering web beacons

A web beacon is a small image that can be used to track whether an email has been opened by a recipient.

Because a web beacon is simply another form of remotely-hosted image, you can use the `src` attribute to perform an HTTP request to that address:

```py
import requests

# ...

image = message.html.images[0]
print(image.src) # "https://example.com/s.png?abc123"

# Make an HTTP call to trigger the web beacon
response = requests.get(image.src)
print(response.status_code) # 200
```

## Spam checking

You can perform a [SpamAssassin](https://spamassassin.apache.org/) check against an email. The structure returned matches the [spam test object](https://mailosaur.com/docs/api/#spam):

```py
result = mailosaur.analysis.spam(message.id)

print(result.score) # 0.5

for r in result.spam_filter_results.spam_assassin:
  print(r.rule)
  print(r.description)
  print(r.score)
```

## Development

You must have the following prerequisites installed:

* [pip](https://pip.pypa.io/en/stable/installing/)

Install all development dependencies:

```sh
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

The test suite requires the following environment variables to be set:

```sh
